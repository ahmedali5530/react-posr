    title: 'Every order action works offline',
    items: [
      'Payments, voids, refunds, splits, merges, covers, table moves, table locks, firing to kitchen and KDS stage updates now commit locally first and sync to the master database in the background.',
      'Taxes, discounts, coupons and extras are computed on the terminal and synced as a single replace operation — no more delete-and-recreate loops.',
      'Floor, orders list, order card and the payment screen read from the local store, so they stay responsive during network or database outages.',
      'Invoice and receipt numbers come from reserved ranges; the terminal warns when the offline pool runs out instead of issuing invalid numbers.',
      'Sync banner shows rejected changes per order with Retry / Discard, and retries unreachable-server pushes with backoff.',
      'Rejected sync changes auto-retry after each successful pull (with cooldown); Sync all re-queues every stuck conflict in one click.',
      'Online terminals can edit the same check (ownership lock applies only offline); floor plan reads the local catalog so floors/tables no longer vanish into a Reload cache prompt.',
      'Create order and settle return to the cashier faster — sync and side effects run in the background; settle skips redundant draft/tax flushes.',

      'Background gateway sync pushes an outbox and pulls master when the network or Surreal returns — no Surreal WASM in the browser.',

      'When the SurrealDB WebSocket drops, create/update/merge/delete writes are queued in IndexedDB instead of failing.',
      'A top banner shows offline status, pending change count, and retry/sync controls (logged-in sessions only).',
      'Queued writes replay automatically when the connection is restored (after a 2-second stability delay).',
      'The app stays usable after the first successful connection — WiFi/airplane-mode changes are detected via navigator.onLine so clicks are not blocked waiting on a stale WebSocket.',

      'Index builds run concurrently on large tables so POS writes are not blocked during deployment.',
