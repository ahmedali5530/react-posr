## Who is POSR for?

POSR is designed for **restaurants, cafés, coffee shops, bakeries, bars, hotels, cloud kitchens, food courts, catering, and multi-location restaurant groups** that need a full operations stack — not just a cash register.

## Why POSR?

Traditional restaurant POS software often depends on cloud connectivity and separate tools for inventory, accounting, staff, delivery, and analytics. POSR combines those workflows in one **offline-first, extensible** platform.

- **Source-available** — inspect, modify, extend, and self-host under [PSAL](LICENSE)
- **Offline-first** — keep selling during internet outages; sync when back online
- **AI-native** — natural-language reporting, inventory/staff forecasts, AI Import
- **Real-time** — WebSocket sync across POS, KDS, manager, and delivery apps
- **Restaurant-specific** — tables, seats, modifiers, recipes, kitchen production, buffet, fiscalization
- **Extensible** — event-driven Integration Manager for fiscal, accounting, logging, and more

## Quick Start

Full install and first-sale walkthrough: **[Documentation → Get started](https://ahmedali5530.xyz/posr/docs)**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ahmedali5530/restaurant-pos
cd restaurant-pos
cp .env.example .env
cp api/.env.example api/.env
cp gateway/.env.example gateway/.env
cp payments/.env.example payments/.env
bun install
docker compose up -d
```

Copied `.env` files include **local-dev** Surreal and JWT values. Change `SURREAL_USER`, `SURREAL_PASS`, and `GATEWAY_JWT_SECRET` before any non-localhost deploy. `root`/`root` is rejected.

**Auth gateway (default):** SPA uses port **3142**, not Surreal **8000**. Set `VITE_GATEWAY_URL` / `VITE_DB_WEBDOCKET` to the gateway; do **not** set `VITE_DB_USER` / `VITE_DB_PASS` in the browser bundle. Details and rollback: [docs/security/GATEWAY.md](docs/security/GATEWAY.md).
